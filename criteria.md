# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->

 Every test question has a post that holds the answer, and my posts are short (178 to 549 characters), so one chunk holds a whole answer. I allow one miss because many posts share a template. For example, every dorm has a laundry post that looks alike, so the wrong building can rank first.

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->

---
The prompt tells the model to name the file, and every chunk sent to it is labelled with its filename. So naming a source should be easy. I want all 5, not 4, because an answer with no source cannot be checked. It would fail if the model ignores the instruction.


## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->
My good questions had a best distance of 0.234 to 0.377. My out-of-scope questions had 0.825 to 0.934. The gap is clean, so I expect a pass. I allow one miss (4 of 5) in case a question lands near the cutoff.

## 4. Something about your chunks
In 10 randomly sampled chunks, at least 8 read as a complete thought that can
answer a question without the chunk before or after it. No chunk is shorter than
100 characters, and every chunk keeps its title line.
<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know if your chunks were the right size? Name something
     countable or observable.

     Examples of the right shape — don't copy these, they should come from
     what you actually saw in Milestone 3:
       - "At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no
          sentence cut in half at either end."
       - "No chunk is shorter than 200 characters, since anything below that
          in my corpus turned out to be a heading with no content under it." -->

**Why this target:**
 My posts are 178-549 characters, and 17 of the 88 are under 250 but are still complete answers (e.g. a 178-character exam summary). So a 250 floor would fail good chunks; 100 only catches a bare heading. Each post is one chunk, so the real risk is a chunk that mixes topics or a "Re:" reply that loses its title, which is why I sample-read instead of only counting characters.

## 5. Your choice
For each of my 5 test questions, every number in the system's answer (minutes, dollars, hours) appears verbatim in at least one of the retrieved chunks passed to the model. All 5 of 5 questions must pass. Any number that appears only in the answer counts as a failure.
<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. It could be about
     speed, about refusals, about a particular kind of question your corpus
     handles badly, about source attribution being correct rather than merely
     present — anything, as long as it names a number or an observable
     outcome. -->



**Why this target:**
All 5 of my test questions have numeric answers. If the number isn't in the chunks, the model made it up.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
